									<h1>What happens to you after COVID infection?</h1>
									<p id="s1">Clinicians and scientists globally are working to
									find out what happens to people as they recover. They are also
									trying to identify any long-term problems that occur. They are
									trying to work out what treatments work and how to help future
									disease. It is unknown what will happen to people as they
									recover, however, there is some information to help from other
									countries as well. Doctors and scientists are also using
									knowledge from recovery from other types of pneumonia. Severe
									COVID disease is defined by the level of respiratory support
									individuals needed when in hospital. This could be where
									individuals needed a lot of extra oxygen or a bedside machine
									to help breathing but were able to breathe for themselves. It
									could also be where they were put on a ventilator that breathed
									for them for a period of time. These patients are looked after
									on an intensive care unit. There are known consequences on many
									aspects of the body when someone needs a ventilator for more
									than two days. Other admissions to hospital are currently
									described as ‘mild to moderate’ COVID disease. These terms are
									used as guidelines to help decide what type of clinical follow
									up care is needed.</p>
								<h2>What might happen to me?</h2>
								<p id="s1">Every individual’s experience is unique. There
									are many symptoms caused by the acute illness. Common symptoms
									include cough, fevers, muscle aches, and lethargy (tiredness /
									fatigue). Some people experienced breathlessness. Symptoms of
									loss of taste and loss of smell were common. The latter
									symptoms are less common with other viruses. Many people will
									make a full recovery. It may take weeks to a few months. We
									expect that some people will have ongoing symptoms of cough,
									breathlessness, poor or reduced sleep, fatigue, anxiety and low
									mood.</p>
